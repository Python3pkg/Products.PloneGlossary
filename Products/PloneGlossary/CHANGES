SVN - 

  * fix bug causing html entities in definition title/description to appear
    as entity code instead of char ( ie. &amp; instead of & )
  
  * Install: check for scripts/CSS before registering them

  * added support for Generic setup for the main tool

  * refactored as it can be overloaded

  * manages many types of glossaries

  * added interfaces

  * added test environment

  * Don't set to debug in config.py by default. [roeder]
    Otherwise there would be a bogus content type cluttering up portal_types.

  * batch navigation in glossary view added [roeder]
  
  * Fixed highlighting : all glossaries are used 
    if no glossary explicitly selected 

  * Added czech translation (Lukas Zdych)

  * Added a patch for ZCTextIndex _apply_index method: search terms with
    synonymous found in global glossaries are replaced by an equivalent "OR". By
    default this is done only for 'SearchableText' . This patch is disabled by
    default (see config.py). [bmathieu]

  * fill portlet by template construct instead of javascript [bmathieu]

  * Dropped plone 2.0 compatibility: use css and javascript registries. Portlet
    structure complies with plone 2.1/2.5 standard structures.
    Improved: highlight definitions whether portlet is displayed or
    not. [bmathieu]

  * Configure Glossary and Definitions to be managed by portal_factory
    [bmathieu]

1.3.3 - 2006-03-01 

  * Added a screenshot in the docs folder

  * Added polish translation thanks to Piotr Furman

  * Fixed a problem in htm2text. Carriage returns were not interpreted
    as white space. This resulted in combined words to be merged.
    For example: "<div>plone\r\nglossary</div>" -> "ploneglossary"
    instead of "plone glossary".

    getting terms sorted by title [b_mathieu] 2006-02-06
