TODO
####

* Cleanup code (we don't need to keep backward compat) to use Zope
  2.10/Plone 3.0.

* i18n cleanup and synch (mail to translators, see README.txt)

* Issue: Why can't we construct ExampleGlossary content in unit tests
  when it works using the UI (1 error in unit tests).

* Migrations from 1.3.3 (?)

* Have the definitions "wicked aware" is essential in a glossary, but
  Wiki support seems buggy since it doesn't work in ATCT anymore
  today.

* Remove the /content/schemata.py dispatch its code in content types
  modules and utils.py.

* Wire rebuildCatalog when a PloneGlossary is renamed or moved using
  events framework.

1.4 CVS/SVN (plone3compat unreleased branch)

  explicitly selected

  is disabled by default (see config.py). [bmathieu]

* Fill portlet by template construct instead of javascript [bmathieu]

* Fixed a problem in htm2text. Carriage returns were not interpreted

  of "plone glossary".
