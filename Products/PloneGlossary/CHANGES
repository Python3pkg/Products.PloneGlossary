SVN - 

  * Added a patch for ZCTextIndex index method: add synonyms from global
    glossaries in indexed text, only for 'SearchableText' by default. This patch
    is disabled by default. [bmathieu]

  * fill portlet by template construct instead of javascript [bmathieu]

  * Dropped plone 2.0 compatibility: use css and javascript registries. Portlet

  * Added a screenshot in the docs folder

  * Fixed a problem in htm2text. Carriage returns were not interpreted
    as white space. This resulted in combined words to be merged.
    For example: "<div>plone\r\nglossary</div>" -> "ploneglossary"
    instead of "plone glossary".
